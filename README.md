| Time complexity | Name  | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1     | Constant     | Constant amount of time
| logn | logarithmic| slower growing than linear functions
| n | Linear | grow linearly with the input size n
| nlogn | Linear Logarithmic | Faster growing than linear but slower than quadratic
| nÂ² | Quadratic | grow faster than the linear
